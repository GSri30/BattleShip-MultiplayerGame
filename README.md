# python-project
This repo consists of my python project which is a battleship multiplayer game done using server-client logic (using sockets,threads and pygame for interface)

Steps to start the game:
<li>First open two terminals and head over to the location where main_server.py and main_client.py files are present</li>
<li>Now type python main_server.py 8000 in one terminal and python main_client.py 8000 in other</li>
